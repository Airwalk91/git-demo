Sixteen lines of blow and I'm fine
Break my bones but act as my spine
Wonder who you'll fuck when I die
And if I tried to call, would you cry?

Please don't cry, you're wasting your time
Sixteen lines to make me feel fine
<<<<<<< HEAD
Wonder who you'll fuck when I die
And if I tried to call, would you cry?
